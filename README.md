# üß® Extreme PDF Compressor

This Python tool applies **brutally aggressive compression** to any PDF file ‚Äî perfect for reducing size to the **absolute minimum**, even at the cost of quality, structure, and editability.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The resulting PDF is **low-resolution**, **grayscale**, fully **rasterized** (text becomes images), with **all metadata removed**. Ideal for archiving, emailing, or storage purposes where quality is not a priority.
